Presentations
=============

The user group welcome slides.

The workflow is pretty simple:
- fork repo
- commit your changes for next presentation
- issue a pull request
- someone will merge it
- when a presentation for a meeting is ready it will versioned as release (lightweight tag & description)
- master branch is the only source of truth, snapshoted from a meeting to a meeting

Create an issue if you want to add sth.
