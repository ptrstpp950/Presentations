Presentations
=============

The user group welcome slides.

The workflow is pretty simple:
1. fork repo
2. commit your changes for next presentation
3. issue a pull request
4. someone will merge it
5. when a presentation for a meeting is ready it will versioned as release
6. master branch is the only truth snapshoted from a meeting to a meeting with GitHub release tool.

Create an issue if you want to add sth.
